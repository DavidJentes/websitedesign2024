            <p>Beacon Blend is the coffee shop run by Lighthouse Christian School as a fundraiser. We serve many varieties of coffee with all of your favorite add-ons. All of our profit supports us to go to A.C.E.'s Regional and International Student Conventions. There, we compete in events in categories such as music, platform, athletics, art, photography, and more. The trip to ISC is where most of the money is spent because of the distance. We appreciate all of the support we receive through the coffee shop, and we aim to please all of our customers with the best service and quality we can.</p>

            <p>Lighthouse Christian School is the model school of A.C.E. School of Tomorrow, located in the world headquarters. Although we are a small school, we make up for it with our unique personalities and interests, as well as our competition at convention. We have other fundraisers besides the coffee shop, like bake sales, vending machines, dinner nights, banquets, coupon cards, and more. All of this money helps us to go to RSC and ISC.</p>
